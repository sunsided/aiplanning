# Missionaries and Cannibals

This project attempts to solve the missionaries and cannibals problem by using an uninformed search.

The problem is given as follows:

* 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals are on the left side of a river
* all missionaries and cannibals must cross a river using a boat
* the boat can carry two persons, but needs at least one operator
* whenever there are more cannibals than missionaries on either side, the missionaries get eaten, which is to be avoided

The program solves this problem by using a breadth-first tree search algorithm.
